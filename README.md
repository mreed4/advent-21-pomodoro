The pomodoro timer was the first challenge in the advent calendar. Going into the challenges weeks ago, I made some attempts on this one. However, I ran into some issues, so I moved onto the other challenges. Now, weeks later, I have returned to this challenge and have completed it.

For one, while I was able to get the basic countdown functionality even during my first attempts, I could not seem to get the timer to pause. [The solution I found](https://inspiredwebdev.com/create-pomodoro-clock/) was to assign the timer to a variable, without using `let` or `const` (or `var` for that matter). Somehow this worked.

The CSS of the challenge in my opinion was rather ugly, so I spruced it up a bit with some animations and color. I also added a few features, including keyboard shortcuts, a sound that plays, and a few other things.
